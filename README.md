# Tech Radar

At [WhereIsMyTransport](http://www.whereismytransport.com), we maintain a Tech
Radar to help our engineering team align on technology choices. It provides us with a structured approach to how we explore, adopt, and retire programming languages & frameworks, platforms, tools, and techniques. 

It is based on the [pioneering work
by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). We've made some adjustments by amending the definition of the rings, similar to what has been done with the [Tech Radar adaptation at Redgate](https://github.com/red-gate/Tech-Radar).
