# Technology Radar

At [WhereIsMyTransport](http://www.whereismytransport.com), we maintain a Technology
Radar to help our engineering team align on technology choices. It provides us with a structured approach to how we assess, adopt, and retire programming languages & frameworks, platforms, tools, and techniques. It also serves as a excellent way to communicate our technology stack to the outside world.

It is based on the [pioneering work
by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). We've made some adjustments by amending the definition and description of the rings, similar to what has been done by the folks at [Redgate](https://github.com/red-gate/Tech-Radar).

# Quadrants

The four quadrants help us organise the blips on the Radar.

 - **Languages and Frameworks** — The programming languages and frameworks we use to build our products and tools.

 - **Tools** — These can be components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions control systems.

 - **Platforms** — Things that we build software on top of, such as runtime and development platforms, like .NET Core, mobile technologies like Android, or virtual platforms like the JVM.

 - **Techniques** — These include elements of the software development process, such as continuous deployment; and ways of structuring software, such as microservices.

 Just like ThoughtWorks, we don't make a big deal out of the quandrants. What's really important are the rings - and where each of the blips sit, and how they move in and out of these rings.

 # Rings

The four rings provide structure to how we choose and adopt technology.

 - **Adopt** — This is a technology you should choose to solve a problem, where applicable. Everything in here forms part of our default set of technology choices.

 - **Explore** — This technology has potential and is worth experimenting with during growth time (i.e. an X-Lab project, SoapBox session, or Lunch & Learn presentation) and/or by trialing on a prototype project or something similar.

 - **Endure** — This is no longer how we do things. It is acceptable for this to still be used in development where it is a standard, but don't adopt it for new endeavours, and consider migrating away from it wherever possible.

 - **Retire** — Don't use this technology! If you are using it then you should be spending some time migrating away from this. 

 Blips will move in or out of the radar, most likely starting their journey in the Explore ring. The closer to the centre of the radar, the closer the techonolgy is to us.
